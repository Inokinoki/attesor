# [WIP] AI-powered reverse-engineering Rosetta 2 for Linux

This repository contains a collection of functions that have been reverse-engineered from the Rosetta 2 binary, which is Apple's dynamic binary translator for running x86_64 applications on ARM-based Apple Silicon Macs. The functions are categorized into two main groups: GF(2^8) multiplication functions and AES cryptographic extensions.
